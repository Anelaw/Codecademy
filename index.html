      <p>One advantage of customizing your clothes is that you can get as creative as you'd like with the style you decide to make, and you'd have yourself a unique design...albeit temporarily as copycats..like me are sure to recreate it if we love it! Ankara fabric can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you're not used to lots of patterns. Hopefully with the following pictures, you'll become a converted Ankara lover!</p> 
      <h2>Jogger and Bomber Jacket Combo</h2>

      <p>This lovely piece can be dressed down with a pair of fancy flat sandals or cute white sneakers. You can also mix and match with plain colored tops or jeans and pants</p>
